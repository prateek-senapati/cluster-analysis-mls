# Cluster Analysis of MLS Players using K Means Clustering and Principal Component Analysis


* In this project, I have used K means clustering and principal component analysis (PCA) to group players having similar attributes and style of play into clusters. 


* This project is inspired by an amazing article titled [COMPARING PLAYERS: CLUSTERING AND STYLE OF PLAY](https://www.americansocceranalysis.com/home/2020/3/3/clustering) by [Sam Goldberg](https://www.americansocceranalysis.com/?author=5e260cf5e3c0a94c0a87edaa) on [American Soccer Analysis](https://www.americansocceranalysis.com/). 


* Head over to [this project's Jupyter Notebook](https://github.com/prateek-senapati/cluster-analysis-mls/blob/main/Cluster%20Analysis%20of%20MLS%20Players%20using%20K%20Means%20Clustering%20and%20Principal%20Component%20Analysis.ipynb) for a detailed cluster analysis of central midfielders from the 2020 season of Major League Soccer (MLS).
